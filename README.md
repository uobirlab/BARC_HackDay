============
Pre-installation:

1. Instal Ubuntu OS. 

  a. Dual system (recommended) - the installation is quick and it will guide you how to install dual system to your existing one. Although Ubuntu 14.04 exists, we recommend to install Ubuntu 12.04 as the ROS libriaries are supported mainly for this version. You can find alternative downloads here:
``http://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads``

  b. Virtual machine - if you dont want to install full operating system, you can install software (Virtual machine), which will emulate Ubuntu in your existing OS. For a Virtual machine software see for example ``https://www.virtualbox.org/``, download ubuntu 12.04 with ROS installed here ``http://nootrix.com/downloads/#RosVM``
  
2. If you have Ubuntu as dual system, follow ROS Hydro installation: ``http://wiki.ros.org/hydro/Installation/Ubuntu``
